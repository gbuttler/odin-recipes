This is my first attempt at building a website from scratch. 

1. Created index.html as my homepage with my selected recipe as a heading.
2. Realised that I needed to save the files in order for them to show up. Felt a little stupid!
3. Followed rest of the steps with ease. 
4. Need to remember to use <li> with list items, so they don't all end up as a giant paragraph.
5. Changed font and colour of Odin title
6. wanted to change the colour of each of the links on the homepage. Realised that I'd have to put the class identifier in both the link and the hyperlink (a) bracket so that everything was covered. Otherwise link would look purole because I'd clicked on it.
7. Changed the titles of my recipe pages
