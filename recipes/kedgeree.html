    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>300g undyed smoked haddock fillet, skin on</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>300ml milk</li>
            <li>4 eggs  </li>
            <li>handful chop  ped parsley</li>
            <li>handful chopped coriander</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
            <li>300g easy-cook long grain rice, rinsed under running water</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For the rice, heat 2 tbsp vegetable oil in a large, lidded pan, add 1 finely chopped large onion, then gently fry for 5 mins until softened but not coloured.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground turmeric and 2 tsp curry powder, season with salt, then continue to fry until the mix starts to go brown and fragrant; about 3 mins.</li>
            <li>Add 300g rinsed easy-cook long grain rice and stir in well. Add 600ml water, stir, then bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer, then cover for 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Take off the heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10-15 mins more. The rice will be perfectly cooked if you do not lift the lid before the end of the cooking.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, put 300g skin-on undyed smoked haddock fillet and 2 bay leaves in a frying pan, cover with 300ml milk, then poach for 10 mins until the flesh flakes. Remove from the milk, peel away the skin, then flake the flesh into thumb-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Place 4 eggs in a pan, cover with water, bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave for 4Â½-5 mins, plunge into cold water, then peel and cut the eggs into quarters.</li>
            <li>Gently mix the fish, eggs, a handful each of chopped parsley and coriander, and rice together in the pan. Serve hot, sprinkled with a few extra herbs.</li>
        </ol>
